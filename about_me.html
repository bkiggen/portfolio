        <p>I am passionate about learning. I want to know everything about everything. That the human mind can create a working model of the world, that shapes on paper can translate other people's models into mine, and that I can have any sense that those things are going on is what I <strong>live</strong> for. Computers are fascinating to me because they're humanity's attempt at recreating that inner world in something inorganic.</p>

        <p>I'm something of a <em>dabbler.</em> Something of a dirty word, I know, but I wear the moniker with some pride. While I'm not having deep conversations in<span class="dirty"> Spanish, Korean, German, Turkish, and Japanese,</span> I can order a beer and hail a cab in any of those languages. While I'm no Yo Yo Ma, I can make the <span class="dirty">guitar, ukulele, piano, drums, and bass </span> sound pretty nice. And while I don't yet have one coding language <em>mastered</em>, I am well on my way to developing skills in <span class="dirty">git, github, html, css, javascript, and react.</span></p>

        <p>I began my professional life in the world of <span class="dirty">Psychology</span>. The jobs I held in my early 20's after earning my BA had me managing the daily lives and wellbeings of 33 people with severe, chronic mental illness. It was intense and fascinating and rewarding.</p>
        <p>After leaving psychology, I came upon an opportunity to live and work in <span class="dirty">South Korea</span>. I was a preschool teacher at an international school in Seoul. It was a great experience and started me on my path to <span class="dirty">education</span>.</p>
        <p>After Korea, I got my master's degree in education at Concordia University. I then taught 2nd and 3rd grades for <span class="dirty">Portland Public Schools</span>. It was a job I felt really good about and it was hard to leave but I knew I needed a new challenge.</p>
        <p>So I saved my pennies, studied computers and code, and eventually enrolled in <span class="dirty">Epicodus' React Track</span>. I'm really excited to see what I can learn to create!</p>
